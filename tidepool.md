## Installing programs on tidepool
There are many ways to install new programs in linux. The best way is to use a repository such as Ubuntu Software Center, apt-get, aptitude, deb, conda, pip, etc... These will compile and install the software in the correct location. 

### Ubuntu Software Center
The easiest and most convenient way to find and install software in Ubuntu is by using Ubuntu Software Center. In Ubuntu Unity, you can search for Ubuntu Software Center in Dash and click on it to open it. You can think of Ubuntu Software Center as Google’s Play Store or Apple’s App Store. It showcases all the software available for your Ubuntu system. You can either search for an application by its name or just browse through various categories of software.

### Debian files
.deb files are similar to the .exe files in Windows. This is an easy way to provide software installation. Many software vendors provide their software in .deb format. Google Chrome is such an example.

You can download .deb file from its official website, usually SourceForge. Once you have downloaded the .deb file, just double click on it to run it. It will open in Ubuntu Software Center and you can install it in the same way as we saw in the previous section.

Tip: A few things to keep in mind while dealing with .deb file.
* Make sure that you are downloading the .deb file from the official source. Only rely on the official website or GitHub pages.
* Make sure that you are downloading the .deb file for correct system type (64 bit).
